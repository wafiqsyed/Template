# Template
Template is a Python application that I developed which allows you to generate a template letter and change just the variables you want to. I originally made it as a cover letter template generator so you could change just the company name and position. However,it can be used for anything.

## Visuals

The application window:

The application comes with a template letter. Here we generate the letter by the info for the variables. 
  - Employer: Apple
  - Position: Manager

You can add as many variables as you like. Here we add skills. Note, you can't have spaces in your variable names.

The application automatically copies the generated letter to your clipboard, so all you have to do is paste it where you want.
